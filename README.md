## 📍 The Process
I started this project because I thought it would be good to practive react with, as it involves moving pieces across a board and storing positions, though right now I have run into serveral errors with the logic I am trying to implement for the movement validations. I am thinking I may have to change the logic behind how the pieces are being moved - but I only did this project to see how elements could be moved and put into different positions so this project will not be my main focus for a while - ill probabl come back to it when i suddenly think of a solution
